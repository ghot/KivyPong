<p>This is currently a proof of concept for creating a functional port of the infamous game 'Pong' to all devices using Kivy and Python. It is all in good humor and fun as well as to build enough experience to create another, more professional app in the workings.</p>

<p>As opposed to simply recreating the game of olden times, we decided to add features to it based on the concept of having the game playable online. As such, we will work on adding characters to play - and yes, they will all most likely be as ridiculous as the two are now. More images, more sound files, more fun, less general boredom for all.</p>

It is simply humorous. Try not to overthink it!</h3>
